# bootstrap-breadcrumbs-for-WordPress-

Once you have installed and activated the custom breadcrumbs plugin, you can use the [custom_breadcrumbs] shortcode anywhere in your WordPress content where you want to display breadcrumbs.

By default, the shortcode will generate breadcrumbs based on the current page's hierarchy. However, you can customize the shortcode by adding the icon attribute and providing a Font Awesome icon class.

To add the icon attribute, simply include it in the shortcode like this:

csharp
Copy code
[custom_breadcrumbs icon="fa fa-home"]
In this example, the fa fa-home class is used to display a home icon next to the "Home" breadcrumb link.

You can change the Font Awesome icon class to any other icon class supported by Font Awesome.

That's it! Simply add the [custom_breadcrumbs] shortcode with the icon attribute to your WordPress content to display customized breadcrumbs with icons.
